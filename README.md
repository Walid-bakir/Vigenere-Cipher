# Vigenere-Cipher

This project is part of the Coursera course, Java programming: ArrayLists and data structure.
I was provided with the source code for three java classes : CaeserCipher, CaeserCracker, and VigenerCipher. And I had to implement the code to break the Vigenere cipher (VigenereBreaker) 

Description:
Giving a encrypted file using the Vigenere cipher, in any of the languages (English, French, Dutch, Portugues, Spanish, Danish, Italian, and German). The programm needs to find the language of the original message, and find the Vigenere key used to encrypt it, decrypt the message and then print it out.

Here is a link where you will find the description of how a vigenere cipher works : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher.
